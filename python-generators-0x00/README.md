# 📚 Python Generators – Advanced Data Streaming Project

## 📝 Project Description

This project demonstrates the advanced usage of **Python generators** for handling large-scale data processing tasks. It showcases how to use `yield` for lazy evaluation, batch data processing, and computing aggregate statistics efficiently — all while interacting with an SQL database.

Throughout the tasks, real-world scenarios such as streaming data, paginated retrievals, and memory-efficient aggregations are simulated to help you apply Python and SQL together in practical, scalable ways.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- ✅ **Master Python Generators**  
  Gain expertise in creating and using generators for efficient, on-demand data processing using the `yield` keyword.

- ✅ **Handle Large Datasets**  
  Implement logic to load and process datasets in **batches** or **pages**, preventing memory overflow and enabling scalability.

- ✅ **Simulate Real-world Scenarios**  
  Simulate streaming data applications and live update processing with Python generators to mimic actual backend service behaviors.

- ✅ **Optimize Performance**  
  Calculate aggregate values like **average age** using streamed data rather than loading full datasets into memory.

- ✅ **Integrate SQL and Python**  
  Write Python functions that interact with a MySQL database using SQL queries to fetch, insert, and manage records dynamically.

## 🛠 Requirements

To run and understand this project, you should have:

- ✅ Proficiency in **Python 3.x**
- ✅ Understanding of **Python generators** and `yield`
- ✅ Familiarity with **SQL queries** and relational databases
- ✅ Experience with **MySQL** (or SQLite) and `mysql-connector-python`
- ✅ Basic knowledge of database **schema design** and **data seeding**
- ✅ Experience with **Git** and **GitHub** for version control

## 🗂 Project Structure

## 🚀 How to Run

Make sure MySQL is installed and running, then:

1. Update database credentials in `seed.py`.
2. Run `0-main.py` to create and populate the database.
3. Use the other scripts to stream users, process in batches, paginate lazily, or compute aggregate statistics.
